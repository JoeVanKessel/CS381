CS 381: Design Document

Introduction

Our language is called wordy. This language has a functional paradigm. 

Design

Core Features:
- Sentence: A string that contains a sentence. This will be manipulated by other feature of the language.
- Count: A feature that counts the number of words within a sentence.
- Reverse: A feature that reverses the order of words within a sentence.
- Insert: A feature that inserts a string into a sentence at a given location.
- Remove: A feature that removes a given string from a given sentence.
- If-Then-Else: A conditional used to branch in our language.
- While: A looping feature that allows repetition while a condition is true.
- Our language uses a static type system this will allow our programs to be checked for type errors while running.

Library Features:
- Capitalize: A feature that capitalizes each letter of a given sentence.
- Lowercase: A feature that makes each letter of a given sentence lowercase.
- Local variables can declared, bound and referenced. 
- Functions can be defined and named to limit repeated code. They will use a call by value parameter           passing scheme.


Implementation

Semantic Domains:

Our semantic domain is as follows:
S→ Maybe Value

We will always take a Sentence, but we may return a String, Int, Bool, or nothing if there are errors. 

This language is used to write programs that manipulate strings.
